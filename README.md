# Lasagna

Welcome to Lasagna, an open-source configuration management tool designed to simplify the creation and editing of configuration files. Our tool is split into a backend service and a frontend user interface, providing a seamless experience for managing your configurations.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy for users to create and edit configuration files.
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Utilizes the `react-jsonschema-form` library to generate HTML forms based on JSON schema files.
- **Schema File Upload**: Users can upload their own JSON schema files through the UI, which will then be used to generate the corresponding form.
- **Real-Time Preview**: As you build your configuration, see a real-time preview of the generated configuration file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports Node.js for the backend and a modern web browser for the frontend.
